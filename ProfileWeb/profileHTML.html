            <p class = "align-left"> Hello, Iâ€™m Sopheanith Ny, a curious and dedicated person who aims to blend creativity with coding. I was born and raised in Cambodia, 
                where I learned the importance of hard work and adaptability.
                 My love for learning grew when I participated in an exchange program, 
                 which opened my eyes to new cultures and experiences. <br>
                
                 <br>During my time as an exchange student in the USA, I discovered my passion for computer science and technology. 
                 This passion has shaped my educational journey at the University of Washington Tacoma, 
                 where I am excited to turn my dreams into reality. <br>

                <br> As someone with an INTJ personality, I tackle challenges with determination and a desire to learn. 
                 I am particularly interested in software engineering because it allows me to solve problems logically 
                 and think creatively. I look forward to applying my skills in real-world situations and 
                 making a positive impact. <br>

                 <br>Outside of coding, I enjoy playing soccer, watching soccer, listen to music and spending time with my family. 
                 My hobbies keep me grounded and remind me of the importance of balance in life. 
                 I also have a passion for Disney and Star Wars, often indulging in movies from both universes. 
                 My ultimate goal is to become a Software Engineer, specializing as a front-end developer and mobile/application developer.<br>
